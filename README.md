# SimpleSFTPSyncCore
Download files ONCE from a remote SFTP, even if you move or delete the files from the download location

This is the new .NET Core version of [SimpleSFTPSync](https://github.com/ScottRFrost/SimpleSFTPSync), which now uses SQLite instead of MS SQL Compact.

As always, input is appreciated!
